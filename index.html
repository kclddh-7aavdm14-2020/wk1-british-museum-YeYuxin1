    <h2>
     the Virtual Tour of the Egyptian Gallery
    </h2>
    <p>
        For thousands of years, ancient Egyptian civilization has been buried in history. This virtual tour has opened its mysterious veil for us. Here, we can see huge sculptures, beautiful murals, one of the earliest human words, etc., which are really shocking. I don't know whether I operated inproperly, I didn't see the detailed introduction of these exhibits on the website. This is indeed a pity.

     Collecttions of China
    </h2>
    <p>
        I also saw a lot of Chinese cultural relics online, such as porcelain, calligraphy and painting. These exhibits are not available in China. As a Chinese, these also remind me of the heavy history. I also hope that some exhibits can return to the embrace of the motherland.

        After arriving in London, I hope to see these cultrual relics with my own eyes.
